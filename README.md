## Installation

This plug-in is intended to be used with the [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x) homebridge management tool. If using _homebridge-config-ui-x_, simply search for _homebridge-grumptech-timetriggers_ for installation, plug-in management, and configuration.

To install the plugin manually:
<br>_`npm install -g homebridge-grumptech-timetriggers`_

## Configuration
### _homebridge-config-ui-x_
This plugin is best experienced when running as a module installed and managed by the [_homebridge-config-ui-x_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x) plugin. When running under homebridge-config-ui-x, visiting the plugin settings will allow you configure and manage the time-based triggers.<br/>
Additionally, especially if this system will be running other homebridge modules, it is strongly encouraged to run this plugin as an isolated child bridge. This setting page can be found by clicking on the _wrench_ icon on the plugin and then selecting _Bridge Settings_. With the child bridge enabled, revisiting the setting page after homebridge is rebooted will show a QR code for pairing the child bridge to your Homekit home.<br/>

### Configuration Settings
The plugin configuration consists of an array of objects containing the configuration for each trigger. The root name of the object containing this array is _triggers_.

| Trip Duration Tolerance | The random time to apply to the trip duration | duration:tolerance | Per Trigger | Number | milliseconds | 0 | 0 | | Allows for a random trip duration. |
| Trip Time | The nominal time for a trigger | timeout:nominal | Per Trigger | Number | milliseconds | 60000 | 1 | | Applies to _Timed_ triggers only. |
| Trip Time Tolerance | The random to apply to the trigger | timeout:tolerance | Per Trigger | Number | milliseconds | 0 | 0 | | Applies to _Timed_ triggers only. |
| Scheduled Trip Hour | The nominal hour to schedule a trigger to trip | time:nominal:hour | Per Trigger | Number | Hour of the Day | 12 | 0 | 23 | Applies to _Scheduled_ triggers only. |

| Days to Trip | Bitmask of the days to trip the trigger | days | Per Trigger | Number | | 127 | 1 | 127 |  Applies to _Scheduled_ triggers only.</br>1:Sunday, 2:Monday, 4:Tuesday, 8:Wednesday,</br>16:Thursday, 32:Friday, 64:Saturday |
| Trip Limit | Place a cap on the number of sequential trip events | trip_limit | Per Trigger | Number | | 0 | 0 | | A value of 0 diables the limit and the trigger will re-arm indefinitely |

## Usage
The plugin will create, or restore, a dynamic accessory for each trigger specified in the configuration. Each accessory will advertise two services: (1) switch, and (1) motion sensors.

The control switch will enable/disable the trigger. The state of this setting is saved and will be restored to the last known state upon restart.</br>
The motion sensor will report that motion is detected when the trigger is in the tripped state. Otherwise, there will be no motion detected.</br>

Some example use cases are:</br>
1. Use the Scheduled Trigger to control lights that turn on/off randomly within a user specified window to give the appearance of being home when you are away on holiday.
2. Use the Timed Trigger with a limit of 1 to provide the capability of delayed control of various accessories. For example to turn the lighs off in 30 minutes.
